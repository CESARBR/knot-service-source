	KNOT Service for Linux systems

KNOT service is part of KNOT project. It aims to provide a "proxy" service
for KNOT nodes, allowing power constrained embedded device to interact
with Meshblu cloud services.

The initial target platform are nRF24L01 nodes, and Raspiberry PI GW. nRF24L01
is a highly integrated, ultra low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC for the
2.4GHz ISM band. On a second project phase, other radio access technologies
such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi are planned.

Dependencies: none

How to build:
$CFLAGS="-I$(pwd)/../knot-proto.git/src" ./bootstrap-configure --enable-debug \
--disable-optimization

'CFLAGS' must include your local knot protocol library folder.

How to check for memory leaks and open file descriptors:
$valgrind --leak-check=full --track-fds=yes ./src/knotd \
--config=$(pwd)/src/knot.conf --proto=http --tty=/dev/USB0

How to test (Unix sockets):
$src/knotd
$tools/ktool connect

Setup before running knotd:
'src/knot.conf' file must be updated according to a valid user settings.

Register an account at 'https://app.octoblu.com' and get the UUID
and token required to change 'src/knot.conf'

How to run 'knotd' specifying host & port:
$src/knotd --config=src/knot.conf --proto=http --host=localhost --port=8000
