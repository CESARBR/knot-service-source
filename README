	KNOT Service for Linux systems

KNOT service is part of KNOT project. It aims to provide a "proxy" service
for KNOT nodes, allowing power constrained embedded device to interact
with Meshblu cloud services.

The initial target platform are nRF24L01 nodes, and Raspiberry PI GW. nRF24L01
is a highly integrated, ultra low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC for the
2.4GHz ISM band. On a second project phase, other radio access technologies
such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi are planned.

Dependencies:
knot-protocol-source
knot-hal-source
knot-cloud-sdk-c
ell >= 0.4
json-c v0.13.1
automake
libtool
libssl-dev
valgrind (optional)

How to install dependencies:
	$sudo apt-get install automake libtool libssl-dev valgrind

	To install libell, you have to clone the repository and follow the instructions:
		git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/ell/ell.git
	To install the latest version of json-c, you have to clone the repository and follow the instructions:
		https://github.com/json-c/json-c/releases/tag/json-c-0.13.1-20180305

How to build:
You have to install the knot-protocol-source and the knot-hal-source,
sothen you can run:
$./bootstrap-configure && make

How to check for memory leaks and open file descriptors:
$valgrind --leak-check=full --track-fds=yes ./src/knotd \
--config=src/knotd.conf --proto=ws

How to test (Unix sockets):
$src/knotd
$tools/ktool connect

How to run 'knotd' specifying host & port:
$src/knotd --config=./src/knotd.conf --proto=ws --host=localhost --port=3000
