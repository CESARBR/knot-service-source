	KNOT Service for Linux systems

KNOT service is part of KNOT project. It aims to provide a "proxy" service
for KNOT nodes, allowing power constrained embedded device to interact
with Meshblu cloud services.

The initial target platform are nRF24L01 nodes, and Raspiberry PI GW. nRF24L01
is a highly integrated, ultra low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC for the
2.4GHz ISM band. On a second project phase, other radio access technologies
such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and Wi-Fi are planned.

Dependencies: none

How to build (server - knot daemon):
$gcc $(pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0) -g0 \
-Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter \
-o src/knotd src/manager.c src/ws.c src/http.c src/main.c

How to check for memory leaks and open file descriptors:
$valgrind --leak-check=full --track-fds=yes ./src/knotd

How to build (client):
$gcc $(pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0) -g0 \
-Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter \
-o tools/ktool tools/ktool.c

How to test (Unix sockets):
$src/knotd
$tools/ktool connect
